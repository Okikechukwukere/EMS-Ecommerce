# EMS-Ecommerce

Fully Responsive E-Commerce website

This UI was shared with me by a friend undergoing a web development course, so I decided to give it a go. There is still The Js part I am yet to code but will soon.

So I came back to this project to update the js part of it and also decided to add a localStorage so as to act as a database to fetch, store and update the ui even when the browser is refreshed.

There are a lots of comment in the code, these are not documention par se, but alogrithm or psuedo codes sort of, which I added to remember what feature I was supposed to add to the project. Those which are not pseudocodes are usually my first attempt to a solution which i commented for refference sake.

Also the naming convention i used was really poor, but this project I did just to get a hang of a coupple of js principles.

Thank You
